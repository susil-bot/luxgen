# Onboarding System Documentation

## Overview

The LuxGen platform includes a comprehensive 4-step onboarding flow designed to welcome new users and personalize their experience. The onboarding system is built with modern animations, responsive design, and accessibility in mind.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ 4-Step Process
1. **Personal Information** - Collect basic user details
2. **Goals & Objectives** - Select leadership development goals
3. **Preferences & Settings** - Configure app preferences
4. **Completion & Welcome** - Summary and next steps

### âœ¨ Modern Animations
- Smooth transitions between steps
- Staggered animations for form elements
- Confetti celebration on completion
- Progress indicators with animations

### ðŸ“± Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Adaptive layouts for all screen sizes
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Optimized for tablets and desktops

### ðŸŒ™ Dark Mode Support
- Full dark mode compatibility
- Theme-aware components
- Smooth theme transitions

## How It Works

### Automatic Trigger
The onboarding automatically triggers for new users when they:
1. Log in with a new email address
2. Haven't completed onboarding before

### Manual Trigger
For testing purposes, you can trigger onboarding by:
1. Clicking the "Test Onboarding" button in the Super Admin dashboard
2. Using the floating action button (bottom-right corner)

### Data Persistence
- Onboarding data is stored in localStorage
- Progress is saved between sessions
- Users can skip and return later

## Components

### Core Components
- `OnboardingContext` - State management
- `OnboardingFlow` - Main flow container
- `OnboardingProgress` - Progress indicators
- `OnboardingTrigger` - Manual trigger button

### Step Components
- `OnboardingStep1` - Personal information form
- `OnboardingStep2` - Goals selection
- `OnboardingStep3` - Preferences configuration
- `OnboardingStep4` - Completion summary

## Usage

### For New Users
1. Register with a new email
2. Onboarding automatically starts
3. Complete the 4-step process
4. Access personalized dashboard

### For Testing
```typescript
import { useOnboarding } from './contexts/OnboardingContext';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { startOnboarding } = useOnboarding();
  
  return (
    <button onClick={startOnboarding}>
      Start Onboarding
    </button>
  );
};
```

### Customization
The onboarding system is highly customizable:

#### Adding New Steps
1. Create a new step component
2. Add it to the `OnboardingFlow` switch statement
3. Update the `totalSteps` in `OnboardingContext`

#### Modifying Data Structure
Update the `OnboardingData` interface in `OnboardingContext.tsx`:

```typescript
interface OnboardingData {
  // Add new fields here
  customField: string;
}
```

#### Styling
All components use Tailwind CSS classes and can be customized by:
- Modifying the existing classes
- Adding custom CSS in `index.css`
- Using CSS custom properties for theming
